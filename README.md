A submission form for entering Lake bathymetrics with a map function coming later

### Description


## Getting Started
Our app uses NodeJS packages, all dependencies are listed in our package.json so you'll need to install them if you want to run our Mongo database and our express servers. You must have an up-to-date NodeJS to install our dependencies, which you can find at their site https://nodejs.org/en/download/.     

Run

    npm i

then

    npm start

View the accompanying back-end server repo [here](https://github.com/SodaPeaks/LakeAPI)

## Built With

    React, Redux, MongoDb, Express, NodeJS, Webpack, Mongoose

## Testing

### TEST DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT (TDD)
The process for creating this app was done using the development technique of Test-Driven-Development. For both Front-end and Back-end sides our app used Test-Driven-Development when testing our routes and models, as well as our reducers and actions for our front-end. This is done to ensure our connections to our database and Redux are functioning before continuing on with further development, this practice is done to avoid app breaking bugs later on.

To run the tests, in your terminal run:

`npm run test:watch`
